    <!-- Fields to this point complete "order-start".  

         If the rest were in a separate POST the response to the above
         would be "order-1". Indicating the server is seeking the
         first item of the order. -->

    <!-- If stopped here the response would be "order-1-inset"

         The model matching this key is called "Cruise Sunset Poster
         19x24". In the Portal this parner has already set the
         "background" asset for this poster. The "inset" asset is
         marked as required. The server response indicates that item 1
         can't complete until a "inset" asset is POST'ed for it. -->

    <input name="order-1-inset" type="file">

    <!-- In the same POST that contains the "file" the multipart
         content for "order-1-inset" should contain the image (png,
         jpeg, etc.) for use as the asset. Note the file contents will be
         tested on receipt.

         At this point the order is complete. If the order were POSTed
         as with an order field of anything except "order-placed" the
         response would be "order-2". This would allow a second item
         to be added to the order.

         If the POST containd the following order field the response
         would contain a order field ofr "order-placed", indicating
         that this order is now validated, complete and ready to
         process. -->
